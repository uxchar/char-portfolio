During the Summer Cohort for Code Louisville Program in 2022, my team was faced with a challenge for Cat-tastic, a fictional social media app for cat enthusiasts to create and share cat-related content. Despite being downloaded by users, the sign-up process was not being completed. We were given three weeks to find a solution to this problem.

### Collaborative Design Process

- Competitive Analysis: We analyzed existing successful apps and their sign up processes to develop a foundation for our own process.

- User Research: We conducted surveys to understand the feelings and behaviors of young user aged 18-35, to figure out what their challeges were when signing up for new services.

- Empathy Mapping: Based on our user research, we developed empathy maps to help us understand our target audience's needs, goals, and emotions.

### Individual Tasks

- User Flow: We each developed a user flow to visualize how our target audience could quickly and efficiently get signed up.

- Wireframes: We each created wireframes to prototype the app's design and structure.

- Prototyping: We each created both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to test and refine the app's design and features.

- Testing: We each showed low fidelity screens to individuals within our target age
  group to guage how close we were to our desired outcome, getting more users to sign
  up.

### Who

Our target users were millennials and Gen Z cat lovers who wanted to quickly start creating, viewing, and sharing cat-related content. They found sign-up forms that required too much information and had too many steps to be cumbersome and time-consuming.

### The Challenge

According to our stakeholders, users were beginnging the sign up process for app, but only 30% were completing the process. Our biggest challenge was addressing the low completion rates of the previous sign-up process without any prior screens avalible to analyze. This meant that we had to rely solely on best practices for sign-ups and qualitative data from user research to find a solution. Additionally, we had a tight deadline and limited resources, which meant that we had to work quickly and efficiently.

### Discovery: Let's Look at the Competition

After defining the problem statement, to align the team, we started by studying the sign-up processes of other competitive social media apps. By examining their app screens, we noticed that the majority of these apps offered social media sign-up buttons for a quick and easy sign-up experience. On the other hand, when these apps did not have social media sign-up buttons, they had no more than a few pages with minimal input fields and incorporated a strong password indicator for data protection. They also offered options for verification such as verify by phone or email. To add, we turned to well-respected UX organizations such as NNG to study best practices for sign-ups.

#### Learning Lesson Note

During the process of looking at other social media apps and gathering user data, the team became bogged down a little with the unimportant details. Valuable time was lost due to thinking about the total app experience rather than our core focus, the sign up process. We felt that we had to create certain delieverables to complete a design process rather just using the UX tools we actually needed. Journey maps and user personas that get too deep into irrelevant information don't add any value or get you closer to the solution, which was our issue. We should have asked ourselves why we were doing it rather than just the what. Eventually, we were able to gather and refocus on our goal.

### How do users feel about sign-ups?

Due to limited time, the team used quantitative data from a survey to gather insights on our users' feelings about sign-ups. The data revealed that users found sign-up processes often too lengthy, required too much information, and had too many steps involved. This was in stark contrast to their main goal for signing up for a social media app - to quickly start creating, viewing, and sharing content.

### Empathy Map

After looking at the user survey data, we moved on to create an empathy map to gain deeper insights into the behaviors and attitudes of our target users. By creating an empathy map, we were able to put ourselves in our user's shoes and design a more user-centered solution that addresses their specific needs and challenges. How can we solve this problem? Utilizing all of our insights gathered during the discovery phase, we generated some general concepts for our signup process and the reasoning behind them. Below is the list I compiled.

- Sign up/login with other accounts
  Quick and easy so certain users donâ€™t have to waste time with a conventional
  sign up process

- Short descriptive call to action to display the value of signing up (feel of value proposition depends on the brand, ex. witty, fun, etc.)
  Informs the user why they should sign up in the first place, how the app gives value

- Need 2 to 3 input fields
  Any other inputs such username could possbily be collected after the initial steps of onboarding allowing for a quick, streamlined process.

- Hide/display password option
  For user privacy purposes to prevent password interception.

- Validate instantly after user inputs email and password with clear error indicators

- Let the user know right away if they input information correctly or show clearly
  what went wrong so that it can be corrected.

- Verify account later option but restrict access to certain features.

- Caps lock indication
  Users should know immediately if the caps lock is engaged, which could lead to frustations and dropouts.

- Show password requirements clearly to the user
  Users should know what is expected and required before entering their password choice to limit confusion.

- If using multiple steps, have indicators on how long the process is and where the user is in the process. Helps indicate to users how long the process will take without guessing which can lead to dropouts.

### Going with the flow

We each created our own user flows based on the ideas generated during the discovery phase. We then compared and combined the results to arrive at a shared understanding of the design. I also created a wireframe, which I showed to users within our target age group to gather feedback. I attribute the generally positive feedback to aligning the sign-in process format with that of other familiar social network applications and not reinventing the wheel here.

### Putting it all together

After creating the wireframe and testing, I set out to design my own take on a high fidelity user interface. As stated before, I wanted to ensure that the design was familiar to potential users. I used my low fidelity wireframe as a guide throughout the design process. I am also aware the solution may not be perfect and may need further testing. Given the short time frame, this is what I was able to come with. I made sure to keep detailed design rational notes throughout the process. The final result is showcased below with said notes.

- Obvious sign up button for new users

- Quick, simple flow with little distractions

- Obvious page titles to let the user know what their doing and what is expected.

- Friendly, cheerful, warm gradient synonymous with what a fun, quirky vibe a social media platform would want to project.

- Password requirement section to help guide user to creating secure, effective password

- Social media logins as the first option front and center as most users according to the research data utilize these elements the most for sign ups.

- Ability to hide and display password for security and in order to help the user see what they typed to confirm password choice

- According to the survey research, a large percentage chose both email and phone for account verification they prefer which led me to include both options for which ever is easiest for the user

- Verify later as an option that would have to be discussed more extensively from a business standpoint. For the user it eliminates friction in the sign up process

### Reflections

In the end, our team was able to design a fast, efficient, and secure sign-up process that aligned with the needs and expectations of our target users. One aspect that I wish I could have done differently is to gather more information from the stakeholders regarding the previous sign-up process. Having a deeper understanding of the root cause of the high abandonment rate would have greatly impacted our solution. However, despite this limitation, my team and I were still able to effectively address the issue and deliver strong results. Although we faced challenges with time constraints and limited testing, we were able to deliver a minimal viable solution that received positive feedback from individuals among our target group, our program mentors, and fellow cohort members. This project taught us the importance of empathy, collaboration, and user-centered design, and we look forward to applying these skills in our future UX endeavors.

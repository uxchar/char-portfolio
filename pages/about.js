          I&apos;m a UX designer based in Louisville, KY and I&apos;m all about
          creating digital experiences that put a smile on people&rsquo;s faces.
          But here&rsquo;s a fun fact about me - I actually have a degree in
          History! I&rsquo;ve found that my passion for researching the past has
          actually helped me develop a keen eye for detail in my designs. From
          the tiniest pixel to the overall user experience, I&rsquo;m always
          thinking about how every little thing can impact the end result. When
          I&rsquo;m not designing, you can find me exploring sound design,
          diving into a good book, or currently learning about 3D modeling. Want
          to collaborate or talk design? Let&rsquo;s chat!
